![Redis](https://redis.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Logotype.svg?auto=webp&quality=85,75&width=120)

The triggers and functions feature of Redis Stack and its documentation are currently in preview, and only available in Redis Stack 7.2 or later. Latest RedisStack is installed and used by default in this notebook (no additional actions required).

The triggers and functions feature of Redis Stack allows running JavaScript functions inside Redis. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger.
